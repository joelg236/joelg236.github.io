# ATALibJ
Java library written for FRC teams, essentially creating a good base to work from. Lots of coding standards and documentation here - probably my most thorough project to date.

# Lethbridge Fringe Website
My first Node.js website, very basic "brochure" website with a captcha contact form. Runs on openshift. Uses expressjs, jade, nodemailer, etc.

# Gordian
Scripting language that's entirely run inside of Java from text files. Not strict or well performing, but accomplished it's goal in FRC to run autonomous modes and settings files.

# Bishop Carroll Tracker

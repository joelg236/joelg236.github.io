title: Making Better Computer Users

I read a post a few weeks ago about using computers titled [Kids Can't Use Computers... And This Is Why It Should Worry You](http://www.coding2learn.org/blog/2013/07/29/kids-cant-use-computers/). I had a range of differing reactions after reading it.

My first reaction was a fierce agreement. I understood where the author was coming from. I see it all the time. I constantly see people struggle to accomplish the most basic tasks on a computer. It frustrates me to no end.

After some forethought, I pondered the actual reasons for people's incompetence. I wouldn't be nearly as upset if the people were unable to do something like cooking. The two are strikingly similar: they are both everyday tasks, they both let the person take control of their finances, and they both provide a valuable skill for a variety of uses. And yet, it's just not an insult to say "you're bad at cooking". Nothing about that hurts somebody who doesn't care about being bad at cooking.

So why does our community assume that it's such a horrible thing to say "you're bad at computing"? I figure we would have a similar outlook if we were dedicated cooks. It would be a common notion to say "everyone should learn to cook!" And why not? Once you understand the potential of being able to do something valuable, you want others to do the same. It's human nature to want to improve society.

But I don't think that's the full story. As a matter of fact, I think that's an excuse for what's really happening. To understand, let's look at what we might think if our goals were accomplished - everyone understood the basics of computing. Everyone knows how to use a command line, write a python script and operate almost any GUI. Where exactly does that put us? What do we think now?

Ideally, we'd be proud of this movement. It'd be a great thing that we all feel a part of. But I'm almost sure this isn't the case. I'll bet it's the opposite of the case. I think that our frustration stems from a much darker place. We want to be able to brag about how good we are, without explicitly doing so. We want to feel like we are "skilled" when almost nobody else is. And there's good reason for this. Having some kind of ability or talent that is rare is exactly what capitalism encourages, as well as evolution. Both demand a constant improvement, striving to be better than everyone else.

And so we complain about people who suck with computers. It makes us, the hacker/programmer community, feel better about ourselves. It makes us feel like we have mastered technology, and everyone is falling behind.

And guess what - they are. You name the technology - be it smartphones, computers, blueray players or game consoles - there is an increasing gap of skill.

But the solution is *not* to attack the people who aren't skilled. That isn't even close to the solution.

The solution is also not limited to *allowing* people to learn, as the author suggests. I agree completely that this is certainly part of the solution. Parents, schools and kids should all encourage others to challenge themselves with technology.

So, what is the problem, and how do we solve it?

### The problem
Our world is becoming almost irreconcilably digital, and will continue this trend. Our people are not keeping up with how these things work.

### The solution
Create an incentive for people to learn.

Notice that instead of *allowing* people to learn, we should create an *incentive* to. And you know just as well as I do that there are already incentives out there. We need to push these, explaining exactly how technology can benefit you more after taking the time to learn. And of course, let people *decide* not to. It's *their* prerogative. Just as with cooking, not everyone has the time or energy to learn a new scripting language every week.

So what are our incentives? There are more, but I'll list some of the obvious ones:

- Becoming faster at navigating user interfaces. This makes everyone more productive, with no downsides. (their going to use them anyways!)
- Being able to solve computer problems without an IT department. This lessens the payroll and increases productivity.
- Being able to solve problems in new and innovative ways. At some point silicon valley shouldn't be the only source of innovation.
- Having a grasp on technology issues that effect everyone - regardless of their knowledge. This includes PRISM, fraud, identity theft and more.
- Save money by knowing how to learn things yourself. All of the courses to learn specific software are a money drain.

With only these 5 simple benefits, we can encourage at least some users to take a dive into technology. Because it's becoming a trend to be "bad with technology", just like being "bad at math". And that's unacceptable. Well, at least we think so.

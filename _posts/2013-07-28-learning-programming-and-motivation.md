title: Learning Programming and Motivation
layout: post
---

I've recently decided to be a better programmer. I have some good experience under my belt. After 2 years of programming with almost zero help whatsoever, I've got some legs to stand under. But I'm not *good* yet.

So how does someone become a better programmer? I figure it's all about learning how to solve problems the right way. Right now, I could solve pretty much 60% of realistic programming problems (not including CS-type questions). I want to be dynamic, able to solve any problem with many different tools.

I'm going to study CS. I've not done any official CS courses, or anything like that. Universities are the only things around here that could be useful for that, but I just can't do that. High school is still taking too much time. So I'll be learning by myself.

## Books
I've ordered a few books from Amazon

- [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0735611319/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i07)
- [The New Turing Omnibus: Sixty-Six Excursions in Computer Science](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0805071660/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00)
- [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0201633612/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i06)
- [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0201485672/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01)

The first book will be my intro to how software and hardware interact. I've really been slacking on understanding this stuff. It'll be really nice to understand the inner-workings of computers so that I can properly use them.

Second book is my intro to CS. I've programmed a lot, but not studied a lot about properly doing things. There are things about programming that just have to be learnt. I think CS is one of those things.

Last two books are programming books. I'd like to get better at using standard techniques, because they are bound to be better than made-up-on-the-spot solutions.

I'm getting these books for reference material, but I will be reading every one of them once over.

## Languages
I'll also be learning the basics of some programming languages. These are my priorities:

- go
- scala
- c
- c++

Ideally, I'd like to learn lisp too. It's on my "maybe one day I'll do it" list, along with Haskell.

## Motivation
It's funny, so far I have only really learnt things by necessity. I needed Java for FRC. I needed bash for automating linux tasks. I needed python for complex scripting and [CSE 1110](http://joelg236.github.io/frc-west-curriculum/courses/CSE%201110/home). I could go on.

So how does someone do something they *know* is good for them, but without any kind of immediate feedback? It's all about motivation and dedication. I know there will be some seriously tough bumps to get over. I also know that I can, and will get over it.

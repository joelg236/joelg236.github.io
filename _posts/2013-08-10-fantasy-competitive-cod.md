You might recognise me as the guy who made the spreadsheet and kept track of stats on gfinity. I had over 800 people check that sheet out, so there's definitely a demand for this. Thankfully we have a few months before the next big event so I'd like to push this idea out.

I'm writing this post to gauge interest in an idea I have. I'd like to make a fantasy competitive COD league for events.

Ideas for voting:

- Everyone votes for a "dream team" (either 4 or 10 players) - their game-to-game stats are combined and ranked (probably based on points)
- Team placing predictions. You can update it after every round but get less points as tournament progresses
- Match results predictions. You predict match results, get points for how close you are

Things I'll need to do:

- Set up website
- Find a good stat tracking method


Suggestions and/or help are appreciated!

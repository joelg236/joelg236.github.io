title: Github needs a new button

Lately I've been looking for some projects to help on. It's very common for people to give new programmers the advice "go work on an open source project!", and I agree with the sentiment.

The thing is, how do you find a project? And once you do, how do you help? Those two questions are almost always left unanswered. From the perspective of someone getting that advice, I have to wonder if anyone has ever successfully done it.

One solution would be just to browse through GitHub. GitHub has a nice [explore](https://github.com/explore) page that I've used quite a bit. Going through languages and timelines, seeing what's new and upcoming can be helpful.

The problem that persists, however, is that the projects you can find are just too big - it's very hard for a beginner/intermediate programmer to contribute something they can learn from. If anything, they'll be doing documentation work or something like that. Very few people sustain interest by doing documentation.

I think this is a problem, but thankfully there are some tools to help. [Ohloh](http://www.ohloh.net/) is nice, although to a newcomer it still shows a lot of very large projects that are hard to start in.

## An "I want to contribute" button
The much larger problem that I've experienced is finding out what I can contribute. Sure, you can say that you can make pull requests that fix bugs you encounter, or add features you want. *A new programmer has no idea where to start*. They need a way to tell the owners that they're ready and willing to help.

That way, the barrier to entry is lowered. There's no longer a big wall in front of the new programmer that they look at and sigh. Sometimes I just don't have the time to look at your entire project - I just want to know what needs to be done.

And maybe, this doesn't come as a "I want to contribute" type thing. It's likely this would be more realistic as some kind of a page that lists things that need to be completed. A lot of projects have "TODO" files or something like that - why not make it a standard? Just like issues.

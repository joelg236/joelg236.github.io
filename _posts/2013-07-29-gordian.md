Between writing an [API for robot control](https://github.com/Team4334/atalibj) and developing [curriculum for high school robotics](https://github.com/joelg236/frc-west-curriculum), I've been working on a scripting programming language named [Gordian](http://team4334.github.io/gordian/).

So, what does Gordian offer that other languages don't? Simply put, it's easy to use, fast to deploy and has really nice syntax.

[The first ever release](https://github.com/Team4334/gordian/releases/tag/v0.0.1)

Gordian was started all the way back in [october](https://github.com/Team4334/gordian/commit/31ba3ec42640e07f685a385781aad691816a7841). It has and always will be designed for robotics applications. But somewhere along the way, it became more useful. It's at the point now that I now consider it useful for other things.

To steal from Gordian's readme file, Gordian is well suited for:

- Very small linear scripts
- Complex control flow with input and output
- Interpreter of input (ie. configuration files)

I'll elaborate on each of these.

### Very small linear scripts
This is exactly what Gordian is used for in my production. We use the language to interpret small text scripts with autonomous commands to run. It makes it easy to deploy, because we only need to save the file through FTP, instead of the long deploying process of Java code. We've even caught the eye of some pretty good robotics teams with this language.

### Complex control flow with input and output
If you need to do something with a variety of loops, conditions and variables, Gordian can perform. It doesn't lack any kind of useful control flow (with the exception of traditional for loops - which I'd argue aren't very useful without an OO or functional language).

### Interpreter of input (ie. configuration files)
You can ignore Gordian's scripting abilities, and treat it as a config file reader. It gives you some awesome features that you wouldn't be able to get with a simple interpreter.

For example, you can do things like this

    var1 = "foo"
    var2 = 13
    var3 = 122
    var4 = "foo 13"
    var5 = 135

In a much nicer way

    var1 = "foo"
    var2 = 13
    var3 = 122
    var4 = var1 + var3
    var5 = var2 + var3

It's always nice to improve readability, extensibility and robustness. Gordian lets you do things beyond direct declarations.

### But why not use python?
Sorry, how's that **9.8mb** download going?

Okay, sure, it's not too big. I'm a huge fan of python actually. But there are some places that you don't want to build and compile python on. Or, you might already be using Java. In that case, you don't want to write python code as well.

So, **when you're limited to Java by platform or existing code, use Gordian**.

## The language
Alright, I've talked enough about what Gordian is and why you should use it. But, what does the language look like?

### The Basics
- Interpreted scripting language
- Run from Java ([SE](https://github.com/Team4334/gordianSE) or [Squawk ME](https://github.com/Team4334/gordian))
- Dynamic type system
- Line breaks or semi-colons as separators
- Methods defined in script and/or in Java
- No objects, classes, pointers, lambdas, function pointers

### The Syntax
The language specification gives a good look at the syntax of Gordian [here](http://team4334.github.io/gordian/#data).

## The Gordian Compiler
https://github.com/Team4334/gordian-compiler

The word compiler here is used *really* loosely. What I really mean is that it assembles a script into one executable file. It's still run in the exact same way as a normal text file. It's use is that it removes any need for gordian to be on the computer. Gordian is compiled into the actual jar file, making the only dependency Java.

Hopefully you'll try out Gordian, and submit your issues [here](https://github.com/Team4334/gordian/issues/new). Thanks for reading.

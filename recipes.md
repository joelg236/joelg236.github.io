    image: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZQvJogE9Fcc/USbPpbs-yXI/AAAAAAAAAtw/7LbaYydIdAY/s1600/lentils4.jpg
    source: https://sites.google.com/site/penniesandpancakes/-slow-cooker-lentil-black-bean-soup
    ingredients:
        - 1 lb. bag dry lentils
        - 1/2 small bag dry black beans
        - 2 medium onions (finely diced)
        - 4 large carrots (finely chopped)
        - 2 (15 oz.) cans diced tomatoes
        - 2 Tbsp. jarred minced garlic
        - 2 Tbsp. cumin
        - 1 Tbsp. chili powder
        - 1 tsp. dried parsley
        - 10 cups HOT water
        - 1 1/2 Tbsp salt (to taste)
        - 1 tsp. black pepper (to taste)
    instructions:
        - Rinse lentils and black beans. Discard any small pebbles or bad beans. Put them in the slow cooker. Add the diced onions, chopped carrots, tomatoes, garlic, cumin, chili powder, parsley, and HOT water to the crockpot. It will be full.
        - Cover, and cook on HIGH for 6 hours. No peeking, no stirring.
        - Remove the lid, and add the salt and pepper to taste. Use a potato masher to mash the soup into a thicker mixture if desired. Serve hot. This soup is very thick (especially if mashed)... almost like chili, and tastes great by itself, over rice, served with wheat crackers, or with cornbread.

    name: Bacon Lentil Burrito
    category: Sandwiches
    image: http://www.lentils.ca/sites/lentils.ca/files/img/recipe/CMS.LentilBurrito2.JPG
    source: http://chefmichaelsmith.com/recipe/bacon-lentil-burrito-2/
    ingredients:
        - 4 slices of thick cut bacon, chopped 
        - 1 onion, diced 
        - 1 tsp chili powder 
        - 1 tsp cumin powder 
        - 1 tsp dried oregano 
        - 1 cup dry green lentils 
        - 4 cups of fresh local water 
        - 1 cup corn 
        - 1 tsp salt 
        - 1 tsp of your favourite hot sauce 
        - To assemble the burritos 
        - 4 large soft tortillas 
        - 1 carrot, shredded 
        - 4 ounces taco-blend shredded cheese 
        - 1/4 cup of your favourite salsa 
        - 1 or 2 handfuls of cilantro leaves and tender stems
    instructions:
        - Begin by crisping the bacon. Toss it into a saucepot along with a splash or two of water. Bring the mixture to a simmer. As the bacon begins simmering the water will encourage it to cook evenly. Eventually the water boils away leaving the bacon bits to crisp in the rendered bacon fat. Be patient. When the bits are crisp strain them out and reserve. 
        - Toss the onion and seasonings into the pan and stir until the flavours brighten and the textures soften, 5 minutes or so. 
        - Pour in the lentils and water and bring the mixture to a slow, steady, simmer. Continue cooking as the lentils absorb the moisture and begin softening. Stir occasionally and keep an eye on the works. Eventually they’ll become tender and absorb all the water, about 45 minutes or so. If the mixtures still seems a bit wet for a burrito filling just simmer a few minutes longer. In the last few minutes of cooking stir the corn, salt and hot sauce into the works. 
        - Lay 4 tortilla shells out on your work surface and evenly divide the filling between them. Top with grated carrot, grated cheese and salsa. Sprinkle on the crisp bacon and top with lots of cilantro. Fold in the sides and roll the works up tightly.

    name: Chili garlic breakfast quesadilla
    category: Quesadillas
    image: http://i2.wp.com/lh3.ggpht.com/_OaYG005JPDs/S3m_CZ8MdYI/AAAAAAAAA1I/2_XxBjPmwok/s640/Chili%20Garlic%20Bfast%20Quesadillas.jpg
    source: http://www.budgetbytes.com/2010/02/chili-garlic-breakfast-quesadilla/
    ingredients:
        - 1 large egg
        - 1 small tortilla
        - 1 tsp chili garlic paste
        - 1/4 cup shredded cheddar
        - 1/2 cup fresh spinach
    instructions:
        - "In a small non-stick skillet, fry your egg until it is set. I like to leave the yolk just slightly runny but beware: the runnier the yolk, the less portable the quesadilla (and there is nothing worse than dripping egg yolk down the front of your shirt before you even get to work. Trust me)."
        - While the egg cooks, smear 1 tsp of chili garlic paste on one half of the tortilla. Top that side with ¼ cup of cheese.
        - When the egg is finished, place the egg on top of the cheese (the heat helps it melt) and then put the spinach on top of the egg. Fold the tortilla over and return it to the pan (keep the heat on).
        - Cook each side of the quessadilla until it is golden brown and crispy (1-2 min each side). Be careful not to spill the contents of the quesadilla out as you flip it. The spinach likes to escape.
        - Wrap your crispy quesadilla in a paper towel and enjoy on the go!

        - 1 large yellow onion
        - 6 oz. smoked bacon
        - 1 lb. white beans (navy or great northern)
        - ½ cup brown sugar
        - ½ cup molasses
        - ¼ cup dijon mustard
        - generous cracked black pepper
        - 4 cups water
        - to taste salt
    instructions:
        - Dice the onion and slice the bacon into 1 inch pieces. Spread the beans out on a baking sheet to sort through and remove stones or bad pieces. Transfer the beans to a colander and rinse with cool water to remove dust and debris.
        - Place the diced onion on the bottom of the slow cooker, sprinkle the bacon pieces over top, and then add the rinsed beans.
        - In a large bowl, stir together the brown sugar, molasses, dijon, and black pepper (do not add salt yet). Once they are combined, stir in four cups of water. Pour this mixture over the beans in the slow cooker. Secure the lid, turn the heat onto high, and cook for six hours or until tender.
        - Give the beans a good stir, taste one to test the texture. Add salt to your liking. If you’re unsure, start with ½ tsp of salt and stir it into the bean mixture well. Taste the beans and add more (just a dash at a time) until it tastes right to you.
